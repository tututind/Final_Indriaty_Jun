# 1. Introduction

## Background

NMBS/SNCB trains, which is the biggest railway serving the country of Belgium, needs to postpone the expansion because of lack of train personnel staff. Also, the raise on energy cost increase the operating cost. Meanwhile, the company still face revenue loss because of low passengers on some routes.

With these problems, the company can strategically plan their policies on optimizing resource allocation, enhancing operational cost efficiency, and also increasing revenue especially on their low occupancy routes. But how can they do that?

## Use Case

This project is aim to predict occupancy levels (categorized by high and low) for different Origin-Destination (OD) pairs of Belgium railway system to allocate resources such as train frequency and size effectively to help transportation planners of NMBS/SNCB or the Transportation Department in Belgium.

e.g. extend/merge train routes, minimize vacant trains or mitigate crowdedness of trains etc.

Question: 

What is the level of occupancy of a certain OD pair at a specific time?

What options do planners have to manage this demand?

e.g. decrease amount of trains, merge of two similar routes, or decrease the frequent of the route to change low routes to medium, and of increase amount of trains, separate two similar routes, or increase the frequent of the route to change high routes to medium.


We build this web-based application, called Re-Train that predict the occupancy rate across the routes with three stages, first analysing and visualizing past data, creating long-term or short-term predictions based on the usersâ€™ need, and last, showcasing potential benefits and risk on the predictions.

This is the interface which shows the latest occupancy rate where orange shows low occupancy routes.
First feature is History trend analysis.
On the top-right corner, user can filter based on those variables and click analysis, to see graph and maps of the train occupancy level in the past.

Second feature is prediction.
you can predict by filtering like the first one, and choose the period time based on your needs.
After clicking the predict, the predicted occupancy rate will result in the percentage of each level and be shown in the map, and also the accuracy percentage & graph below the map.

Last feature, you can check on the cost benefit analysis based on the scenario of the prediction which will show you the potential benefit & potential risk of optimizing routes on those period of time.
Then, you can export the report to help you make decision based on that.

How it works?

We use Kaggle train occupancy level data on 2016 which have these variables that potentially correlate with the occupancy rate.
And add some external datas like weather, demographic, and fare, and then predict using logistic regression.

Taking a look at the data, we can see a clear distribution between high and low occupancy where: Low occupancy routes are most prominent during off-peak hours, on weekends, and scattered throughout the date but peak on early July-August.
Meanwhile high occupancy routes are strong during commuter hour, on weekdays, and spikes on mid-late October.

From this, we can see high-demand OD pairs are consistent, while low-demand OD pairs keep on changing.
High occupancy is concentrated on major intercity and commuter routes.
Meanwhile, smaller or regional routes shows reduced demand.
But there are two quite big OD Pairs that dominate low-occupancy, possibly indicating a mismatch in train frequency with actual demand.

The modeling approach uses binomial regression to predict train occupancy (high or low) while identifying key factors that are validated through k-fold cross-validation for robustness.
Also, a confusion matrix will assess the model's predictive accuracy and reliability which is shown in the app through accuracy percentage and graph.

To minimize the risks of misclassifying high-occupancy routes as low, we set a higher threshold to ensure only routes with a strong likelihood of low occupancy are chosen just like shown on the animation example, It will prioritize service reliability and passenger satisfaction.

By correctly predicting low-occupancy routes, we can achieve significant cost savings in maintenance, labor, and energy while avoiding wasted resources.
However, misclassifying high-occupancy as low can lead to revenue loss, overcrowding, and passenger dissatisfaction.
Striking the right balance in predictions ensures optimized resource allocation and supports a sustainable and efficient rail network.

```

## Load Data

We loaded three default data (1)-(3) of NMBS trains, stations, and lines from Kaggle, and four additional data (4)-(7) of Belgium statistical tracts, Belgium population data, zone station data, and weather data from RIEM package. 

(1) Trains dataset

The training dataset of trains provides date, time, origin station code (`from`), destination station code (`to`), vehicle ID, and occupancy information shown at three different levels (low, medium, high), from July 27, 2016 to October 29, 2016. The test dataset of trains have the same columns as the training dataset, but from October 29, 2016 to December 19, 2016. The test dataset does not have occupancy level information.

(2) Stations dataset

The stations dataset contains names, locations (longitude and latitude), and average stop times (`avg_stop_times`). Since NMBS operates trains in Belgium as well as France and the Netherlands, we filtered the dataset to exclude non-Belgian stations (e.g. those in the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg etc.). Additionally, we created columns to calculate the distance between origin and destination stations, the distance from Belgium to the origin and destination stations, and the bearing between origin and destination stations. 

(3) Lines dataset

The lines dataset includes information about the vehicle ID, vehicle type, the number of stops, and stopping station IDs. Since the information in the train dataset is insufficient, we did not use stopping station IDs in this analysis.

(4) Belgium statistical tracts dataset

The Belgium statistical tracts dataset contains the geometries of each tract. We gained this dataset from Statbel, the Belgian statistical office. We joined this dataset to calculate the population of Belgium by municipality and intersect this dataset to the stations and the weather stations.

(5) Belgium population dataset

We assumed that the population of the origin and destination regions would affect the occupancy level of the trains. We used the Belgium population dataset to calculate the population of Belgium by municipality and joined this dataset to the statistical tracts dataset.

(6) Zone station dataset

The zone station dataset contains the zone information of each train station. At first, we assumed the fare information may be one of the independent variable so we added this information to the stations dataset to calculate the fare. However, we could not find the opened fare information of NMBS, so we did not use this information in the analysis.

(7) Weather dataset

We assumed that the weather conditions of the origin and destination regions at specific dates and times would affect the occupancy level of the trains. The dataset is from RIEM, which is developed by Iowa Environment Mesonet. Since RIEM provides global coverage, we were able to get temperature, wind, and relative humidity data from 12 weather stations located in Belgium airports. Since the percipitation data of Belgium was unavailable in RIEM, we used relative humidity as a substitute variable to reflect general patterns related to precipitation.

```{r loaddata, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
# Load (1) trains, (2) stations, and (3) SNCB lines data
line_info <- read.csv("./Data/line_info.csv") 
trains_test <- read.csv("./Data/trains_test.csv") 
trains_train <- read.csv("./Data/trains_train.csv") 
stations <- read.csv("./Data/stations.csv")

# Load (4) Belgium statistical tracts and (5) population data
statBel <- st_read("./Data/sh_statbel_statistical_sectors_3812_20240101.geojson") %>%
  st_transform(4326) 
popBel <- read_excel("./Data/TF_POP_STRUCT_SECTORS_2016.xlsx") # 2016 Belgium population data by tracts

# Load Zone station data to calculate fare
stationZone <- read_excel("./Data/station-zone.xlsx") 

# Filter stations data to exclude non-Belgian stations (Netherlands, France, etc.)
stations <- stations %>%
  filter(country.code=="be")
stations <- left_join(stations, stationZone, by = c("name" = "Station")) # Add zone information to stations)

# Stat tracts and population of Belgium by municipality
statBel_muni <- statBel %>%
  group_by(cd_dstr_refnis) %>%
  summarize(geometry = st_union(geometry)) %>%
  ungroup()

popBel_muni <- popBel %>%
  mutate(CD_REFNIS_N = as.character(as.numeric(substr(CD_REFNIS, 1, 2)) * 1000)) %>%
  select(CD_REFNIS_N, POPULATION, TX_DESCR_FR) %>%
  group_by(CD_REFNIS_N) %>%
  summarize(POPULATION = sum(POPULATION)) 

statBel_muni <- left_join(statBel_muni, popBel_muni, by = c("cd_dstr_refnis" = "CD_REFNIS_N"))

# Clean up the URI column to extract the station IDs
stations <- stations %>%
  mutate(station_id = gsub("http://irail.be/stations/NMBS/", "", URI))

# Convert stations dataset to sf object
stations_sf <- stations %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)
```

## Data Wrangling

We transformed raw data into a more usable format for analysis through the following processs. First, we combined the training and test datasets to manipulate the entire dataset at once. After we finished the data wrangling, we separated them again into training and test sets.
Second, we recoded occupancy data from three-level (Low-medium-high) to two-levels (Low-high). 

```{r setup_panel1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Change station code from numeric to character and rbind train and test sets
trains_test$from <- as.character(trains_test$from)
trains_test$from <- paste0("00", trains_test$from) 
trains_test$to <- as.character(trains_test$to)
trains_test$to <- paste0("00", trains_test$to) 
trains_test$occupancy <- NA

# Rbind train and test sets
trains <- rbind(trains_train, trains_test)
#trains$occupancy <- factor(trains$occupancy, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
# Believe this causes regression error

# Convert date and time to POSIX datetime
trains$datetime <- as.POSIXct(paste(trains$date, trains$time), format = "%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S %p")
trains$week <- week(trains$datetime)
trains$dotw <- wday(trains$datetime, label = TRUE)

# Update vehicle ID
trains <- trains %>%
  mutate(vehicle = case_when(
    grepl("^\\d+$", vehicle) & vehicle %in% c("7006", "7966", "8011", "8015") ~ paste0("P", vehicle),
    grepl("^\\d+$", vehicle) ~ paste0("IC", vehicle),
    TRUE ~ vehicle
  ))

# Recode Low-medium-high to Low-high
trains$occupancy_original <- trains$occupancy
trains <- trains %>%
  mutate(occupancy = recode(occupancy, "medium" = "high")) %>%  # (1) Recode medium to high
#  mutate(occupancy = ifelse(occupancy == "medium", NA_character_, occupancy)) %>%
  # (2) Remove medium to high
  mutate(interval60=ymd_h(substr(datetime, 1, 13))) %>%
  mutate(week=week(interval60)) 
```
